A git based labeling app to manage notes, documents, and bookmarks.

## Why notemarks?

- **Mixing notes, documents, and bookmarks**: My note-taking approach is an interplay of notes, documents (e.g. papers), and bookmarks. For instance, in some cases a note revolves around a bookmark or document, in other cases a note evolves into a collection of links. In notemarks all three can be mananged in a coherent system.
- **Hierarchical label system**:
- **Access notes & bookmarks from everywhere**
- **Full git integration**: I love git, and for me, note-taking has to be done in git. However entirely manual pull/commits/push cycles can become a bit tedious. Notemarks provides some convenience to perform these standard steps with just a few mouse clicks.
- **Multi Repository Support**: Want to separate your work notes from private notes, or tech notes from cooking recipes? Notemarks supports storing all entities across multiple repositories, which can be enabled/disabled depending on the context.
- **Keyboard friendly UI**
- **No vendor lock in / open source**
