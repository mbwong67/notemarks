A git based labeling app to manage notes, documents, and bookmarks.

## Why notemarks?

- **Mixing notes, documents, and bookmarks**: My note-taking approach is an interplay of notes, documents (e.g. papers), and bookmarks. For instance, in some cases a note revolves around a bookmark or document (e.g. a paper), in other cases a note evolves into a collection of links. In notemarks they can be mananged in a coherent system.
- **Hierarchical label system**:
- **Access notes & bookmarks from everywhere**
- **Full git integration**
- **Keyboard friendly UI**
- **No vendor lock in / open source**
